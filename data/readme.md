## Data use restrictions
The source dataset comes with the following data use restrictions:

The Public Health Service Act (Section 308(d)) provides that the data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), may be used only for the purpose of health statistical reporting and analysis.

Any effort to determine the identity of any reported case is prohibited by this law.

NCHS does all it can to ensure that the identity of data subjects cannot be disclosed. All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics that might lead to identification, are omitted from the data files. Any intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information.

Therefore, users will:

- Use the data in these data files for statistical reporting and analysis only.
- Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any such discovery (1 (800) 232-4636).
- Not link these data files with individually identifiable data from other NCHS or non-NCHS data files.
- By using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the above requirements.
